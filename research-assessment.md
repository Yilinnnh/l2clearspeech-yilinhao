# Research Project Assessment

**This assessment is for the final research project only.** Use the `assessment.md` file for all mini-projects.


## Instructions

Before submitting your research project draft for grading, confirm:

1. The manuscript .qmd for your project is in the root directory and knits to .pdf without error.
2. The knitted .pdf of your draft is in the root directory, with the same filename as the .qmd.
3. This `research-assessment.md` file is in the root directory of your project repo.
4. Dr. Dowling and your section TA are collaborators on your GitHub repo with permissions to pull/push.

To complete this assessment:

1. Complete the basic information section and AI statement. 
2. Confirm all links are correct and accessible
3. Check off all objectives you are attempting to demonstrate
    1. To earn 30 points you must demonstrate each objective. However, you do not need to attempt all objectives with each draft if your goal is to build the project over time.
    2. If the objective is demonstrated somewhere other than the .qmd, add a note in the grader comments section for where to find it (e.g., "see `data-cleaning.R` lines 20-30").
4. Optionally, complete the reflection section, which may earn engagement points.

## AI Statement

Describe whether and how you used AI/LLMs when completing this project: 

I used chatgpt to help me with errors I couldn't figure out myself.

Optionally (for engagement points) reflect on your use of AI:

Chatgpt is very good at identifying potential reasons behind errors and suggesting solutions. For instance, when I successfully installed a package in R but couldn't require it, chatgpt provided multiple ways to check whether the installation was correct, if the package was located in the right path, and whether it was compatible with its associated dependencies. However, it sometimes offers more complex solutions that may not be necessary, so it's important to evaluate and filter the recommendations accordingly.


## Overall requirements

Overall requirements for the research project are as follows:

1. The project must be a research project. It must provide background on a research topic, ask at least one research question, use data to attempt to answer that question, report the results of the data analysis, and interpret the results in the context of the research question.
2. The project must be contained in a github repository that follows git best practices and includes all necessary files to run the project from start to finish, including:
    1. The .qmd file for the manuscript
    2. All data files used in the project
    3. All scripts used in the project
    4. A README.md file & .gitignore file
3. The project must be reproducible -- a reader should be able to clone the repo and run the .qmd from start to finish without error. The .qmd file should include:
    1. A YAML header with all fields necessary for an APA manuscript
    2. Setup source chunks that load libraries, read in data, set chunk options, set seed, etc.
    3. Minimally, an IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), though it may be more complex
    4. Integration of markdown and code chunks throughout, following best practices for using code chunks
    5. Figures and tables rendered in code chunks
    6. Inline R code & references to render data-dependent text
    7. At least 1 descriptive analysis and 1 hypothesis test, either in code chunks or sourced scripts
    8. Frequent and informative code comments throughout
4. The .qmd file should knit/render to an APA7 formatted manuscript with one click and no errors. The knitted manuscript should include:
    1. A title page with title, author, and institutional affiliation
    2. An abstract (this may be minimal, but should exist)
    3. Narrative text comprising a complete research report
    4. APA7 references, both in-text citations and a References page
    5. Publication-ready figures (2+) and tables (1+)
    6. Results of all analyses presented in-text (and where appropriate, in tables), with no raw R output; where possible, all text should be data-dependent and rendered with inline R code
    7. Quarto generated references to all figures and tables
    8. Statistical analyses and figures interpreted in narrative text
5. The .qmd should render a .pdf identical to the .pdf you submit for grading


## Assessment

The final project must demonstrate each of 30 the course learning objectives, each worth 1 point. 

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

Refer to the website for general tips on meeting these objectives and an FAQ.

### Data analysis

17. Perform simple descriptive analyses with multiple data types

    1. Calculates summary/descriptive statistics for at least 1 numeric variable (e.g., mean, standard deviation) 
    2. Calculates summary/descriptive statistics for at least 1 non-numeric variable (e.g., frequencies, proportions)

    1. Includes all sources cited in-text
    2. Formats references in APA7 style
    3. Presents accurate, complete, and error-free references

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: looks good with just the 2, but be sure it stays clean and proofread when you add more!

### Notebooks and code chunks

22. Create and effectively use code chunks following best practices

    1.  Uses informative names/labels
    2.  Includes frequent, informative comments
    3.  Follows the "1-chunk-1-thing" rule
    4.  Chunks are distributed throughout the manuscript, sensibly placed near the text they support

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: 
        
23. Use code chunks to set up a quarto document

    1. Sources at least 1 .R script and/or reads in necessary data
    2. Loads packages in at least 1 code chunk
    3. Sets preferences/options in at least 1 code chunk
    4. Organizes setup chunks sensibly

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
        
24. Render publication-quality tables, figures, and images from code chunks

    1. Produces at least 1 table or image with a caption
    2. Produces at least 1 figure/plot with a markdown caption (title) and note
    3. Captions are informative, complete, and render correctly
    4. All tables and figures are referenced in the narrative text (e.g., Figure 1)
    5. References render without error and link to the correct table/figure in pdf/html output
    - NOTE: Ideally your table(s) should be produced in APA7 style, but this is not a strict requirement. At a minimum, they should render as formatted tables (not raw output), have readable and correctly formatted text (e.g., column headers should be capitalized and in plain english, not literal variable names), and the table must be dynamically referenced in the text.

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: Your figures and table look great - you just need to change how you label/title. You shouldn't assign a figure/table number manually anywhere. The fig-cap should be the title (vs putting it in the title argument of the ggplot). Using unique labels (like you've done) will generate the figure/table numbers for you.

25. Execute descriptive and inferential analyses in code chunks

    1. At least 1 code chunk executes a descriptive analysis (e.g., `summary()`, `table()`)
    2. At least 1 code chunk executes a hypothesis test (e.g., `t.test()`, `chisq.test()`)
    3. Results are presented in narrative text, table, or plot
    4. Results are not displayed as raw R output
    5. Chunks are organized sensibly and appear near the text they support

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: 

### R Markdown and Quarto

26. Create and maintain a quarto document YAML header
    
    1. Includes all necessary metadata, output options, and formatting options necessary to render an APA styled document (or other specified style if appropriate for the project)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
        
27. Use quarto R Markdown to compose an academic manuscript

    1. Uses at least 2 unique text styles (e.g., bold, italics, code)
    2. Uses at least 2 unique header levels
    3. Includes at least 1 list
    4. Includes at least 1 footnote
    - NOTE: This is going to be one of the most flexible objectives to demonstrate.  You need to demonstrate a range of markdown skills and use them to make a readable, informative manuscript. Hitting the four points above should do that, but you can use your judgment about what kind of markdown features will best serve your project. No matter what, you should use markdown to follow APA7 guidelines.

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
            - I don't see any markdown stylized text or markdown elements like lists, footnotes, etc.
            - be careful with formatting text around reported results. right now you've got backticks surrounding some text (e.g., ln274), which makes it render as raw code in the wrong font. You probably are looking for $ instead

28. Use inline R variables to replace static text

    1. Replaces static text with inline R references in at least 3 unique numeric contexts
    2. Replaces static text with inline R references in at least 1 character context
    3. Ideally, uses inline R references for *all* data-dependent text

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

29. Run inline R functions to render dynamic data-dependent text

    1. Uses inline R functions to render at least 3 unique data-dependent text outputs (e.g., performs rounding, calculates means, subtracts one list length from another, etc. -- inline rather than in a code chunk)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
        
30. Use `knitr` and quarto to produce an APA7 formatted 1-click PDF manuscript

    1. Produces a PDF output that is formatted in APA7 style
    2. PDF includes all necessary elements (e.g., title page, abstract, body, references)
    3. PDF renders without error and includes all text, tables, and figures
    4. No additional steps are needed (e.g., finding data, determining necessary packages to install and load, running unsourced scripts, correcting aboslute paths)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:        
   

## Reflection (Optional)

Optionally (for engagement points) write a brief reflection about your work on this project. You can use this space to answer the following questions, but feel free to ignore these questions and write about whatever you think is most important.

- What was the most challenging aspect of this project?
- What was the most rewarding aspect of this project?
- What would you do differently if you were to start over?
- What did you learn from this project that you will carry forward to future projects?
- What are you most proud of in this project?

The most challenging and also most rewarding aspect of the project is to figure out how to create meaningful analyses and results while also effectively meeting the objectives. This process pushed me to think deeply about my dataset and explore how I could analyze it from different perspectives. By trying to align my analyses with the project objectives, I was able to uncover various ways to interpret the data, considering different statistical models, and visualization techniques. This project taught me how to use R to create an APA-style manuscript, including inline references, creating APA-style YAML header, etc. These skills are really valuable, as they have prepared me for drafting my thesis manuscript.

Alternatively/additionally in mind some of the suggested ways to earn engagement points, and expand on this (or other aspects of your project) in your reflection:

- Creating many figures and tables, or particularly complex or creative ones
- Impressively thoughtful and thorough narrative writing in your literature review or discussion section
- Employing sophisticated statistical techniques in your analysis
- Making excellent use of markdown features to create a polished final product
- Having a maximally reproducible and dynamic manuscript
- Fully committing to best practices for version control and GitHub integration/organization




## Grading

All final projects are graded by Dr. Dowling. You will see your grade on Canvas separated into two categories: objective points and engagement points.

-   **Objective points:** 13/30
-   **Engagement points:** 2/10
-   **Total points:** 15/40

**Comments:** Great start, Yilin! You've got a really strong foundation here. A few tweaks needed on some things, but for the most part you just need to fill in the gaps and you'll be in great shape.
